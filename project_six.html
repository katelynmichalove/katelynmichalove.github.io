            <p class="client_quote">At Sunbelt Rentals, much of the business is still done over the phone, from ordering to managing their equipment rentals and invoices. Our goal for this section was to increase online payments by 20% and decrease time to task for finding invoices by 50%.</p>

The users that did use the online platform, were unable to download or view an invoice. The balance information displayed at the top of their screen was incorrect and confusing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution">
            <h2 class="section_title">The Solution</h2>
            <p>We allowed for credit to be applied to an invoice. In the case where the invoice was already paid, we gave the option of applying these credits to another open invoice or requesting a refund. We made it easy to view and download invoices in order to encourage online payments. Incorrect data was removed, and valid, helpful data was placed at the top. Users were never left at a dead end, while new live search and filtering options helped them find their way.</p>

                The new feature that allows users to apply a credit has not yet been implemented. It has taken some time to work with the financial team and get properly set up to push this new feature. I’ve realized that we really should have pushed for these discussions when first accessing the research and determining the need. We may still not be ready to push it live, but it would put us a month or two ahead of the current schedule. While moving into this next section of redesign, I’ve made sure to discuss big feature changes with all stakeholders very early on.

                With the short amount of time, we had to fully concentrate on the external, customer users. Given more time, I’d like to look at how we could create an employee version. Oftentimes, sales reps or customer service reps are looking at a customer’s account to help them manage their account. There is a potential to supply them with important details that may help build a better relationship, gain an increase in sales, and better retain customers.

                This first section on the product roadmap was redesigned very quickly in order to speed up the timeline. This meant less time working with stakeholders and developers. Developers really needed more communication and development research time for new feature additions. In the next section of the product roadmap, I was able to have collaboration with stakeholders and developers so they could be very well prepared for the next section’s development.
