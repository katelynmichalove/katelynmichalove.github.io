            <p class="bold-purple sol">Chip In has three levels of background checks that organizations can choose from as a requirement. Volunteers can submit a request for a background check to participate in an opportunity. Their background check level will be shared with other organizations of the same level, eliminating repeat checks.</p>

                Just serve allowed volunteers to filter by their interests but you had to sign up for shifts outside of the application.

                Verified volunteers has a great level system for background checks that can be shared between organizations, but volunteers can’t use it on their phones which is the preferred platform.
              </li>

                Golden Volunteer Opportunities focused on social media, but volunteers aren’t interested in making their volunteer work public.

                <p class="round-one">After user feedback, I altered my wireframes for further testing. Below were the key takeaways:
                <ul class="list">
                  <li class="key-takeaway">
                    The ‘Sign In’ option on the introduction screen was mistaken as a ‘Sign up’ button by users and drew out their sign up process.
                  </li>
                  <li class="key-takeaway">
                    The apply button used on the filtering screens is at the bottom which can be hard for users to find when dealing with a long list of options like in the interest filter.
                  </li>
                  <li class="key-takeaway space">
                    Users need a signal showing them that their background check is approved.
                  </li>
                  <li class="key-takeaway space">
                    On the shift schedule screen some users want to keep scrolling through the list of shift options until they reached their desired choice, instead of horizontally scrolling on the calendar or selecting a specific date.
                  </li>
                  <li class="key-takeaway space">
                    Users had trouble with saving an opportunity with the heart. It was noted to be monitored in the higher fidelity stages due to the heart not being as noticeable in this low fidelity stage. I also needed to put the user in a specific scenario so they could understand why they would click the heart icon.
                  </li>
              </ul>

            <p>After alterations and another round of usability testing, all previous problems were resolved. In this round users wanted to go to the ‘Schedule’ tab to schedule a shift after they were approved for the background check. I redesigned this screen to accommodate for this pathway.</p>

              <p class="branding_intro">The branding for Chip In began with mind mapping. I spent time thinking of many words related to volunteer work, community, and giving back. I finally settled on Chip In which conveys a very fun and light tone which matched well with the targeted users of ages 18-37 years old.</p>
              <img src="Images/Mind Mapping.jpg" alt="Mind Mapping Exercise Drawing" class="mind_mapping"/>
              <p class="branding_intro">Next came the rough logo sketching and refinements. I had several options and many of them would match the desired branding. I reached out to other designers for feedback to decide on a direction for refinement.</p>

                    <li class="key-takeaway">

                      The notification banner was designed to let the user know if a shift had been successfully added to their schedule or rescheduled. The past design looked very similar to a call to action button and not enough like a message banner. I did some research into success messages and redesigned it to make more sense for the user.

                      The background check levels could make the users think that their profile or account is incomplete if they are a level 1 since it shows a completion circle around the badge. It was not intended to convey this and needed to be adjusted to show only the level.

                I would perform more testing to see how secure users perceive the background check process to be and how I could improve it.
              </li>
              <li class="key-takeaway">
                I would change the “Request Background Check” button to a “Complete Requirements” button in order to add in a form for references and a schedule page for signing up for training.
              </li>
              <li class="key-takeaway">
                I would also see if it would be preferable to have a filter button that contains all three filters or keep the three filter choices on the dash. I started with only two filters so I didn’t see a need for it, but now that there are three it would be beneficial to perform a test.
              </li>
              <li class="key-takeaway">
                I would think of several iterations of the shift schedule. The one I designed is for an MVP and was user focused in its visual and ux design, but I believe there could be a more convenient schedule design.
              </li>
              <li class="key-takeaway">
                Is there a way to work with organizations so that users can just get a Level 3 background check? This level is more expensive but the organizations could share cost since they are able to share background verifications. Although users already only enter their information once, this would eliminate levels all together and would allow users to submit one request only.
              </li>
              <li class="key-takeaway">
                One user type is focused on schedule because they are very busy and want to fit in a shift here and there. What percentage of the user base is this user? This user would like to first find a time that works for them and then see what opportunities are available. If this is a large percentage of the user base, I would want to see how I could design the app to allow this flow.
