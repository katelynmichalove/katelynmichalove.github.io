            <p class="client_quote">Although Sunbelt Rentals is seeing a large growth in the equipment rental industry, much of the business is still done over the phone, from ordering to managing their equipment rentals. Our goal is to increase online engagement and help customers enter into the shopping experience from the location page. We needed to consider SEO on the store details pages to help drive traffic and allow for store personalization such as promotions or equipment offerings.</p>

            <h5 class="white">THE USERS</h5>
            <p class="client_quote">Users needed to find a store nearby that offered the equipment they needed, quickly determine the store hours for the day, and enter into the online shopping experience once their store was identified.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution">
            <h2 class="section_title">The Solution</h2>
            <p>The locations page of sunbeltrentals.com was designed to always find at least one location near the user and allow them to filter by equipment offered and the miles away. The user can interact with the map or list to see the details that are most important to them like today’s hours, the address, the store name, ability to get directions, see details, and call the store. On the store detail page, the user is never left at a dead end through the use of an ‘other stores’ component. The user can select from an equipment category and enter into the shopping experience, knowing that their store has the items they need. The addition of text and marketing components allows for SEO and store personalization.</p>

            My team researched comparators and competitors such as Best Buy, CharlesSchwab (identified as best in class by NN Group), REI, Target, Starbucks, United Rentals, and Ikea. We used a FigJam board to pull in screen shots and identify patterns.

              Information and actions commonly found on the store listing page: store name, miles away, hours, address, phone number CTA, view store details CTA, get directions CTA, ‘Make this your store’ CTA, and filter by services.
            </li>
            <li class="key-takeaway">
              Information and actions commonly found on the store details page: all hours for the week including holiday, get directions CTA, phone number CTA, map view of the store, other stores nearby, ‘Make this your store’ CTA, marketing content, reviews, store description, store services or products.

          <ul class="list">
            <li class="key-takeaway">
            It was a surprise that many users were finding a location before placing an order online. We knew we needed an easy way for them to enter into the shopping experience.
            </li>
            <li class="key-takeaway">
            ‘Get directions’ needed to be prominent and available on both the store details and store listing page.
            </li>
            <li class="key-takeaway">
              Users wanted the ability to ‘Set as my store’ so we accounted for this in our designs knowing that this would be a post launch improvment.
            </li>
            <li class="key-takeaway">
              The type of equipment offered at the store was very important for the user, so we incorporated this into the filter options as well as on the store details page.
            </li>
            <li class="key-takeaway">
              Other information such as the miles away, store hours, and address were given hierarchy on the store listing page as well as on the store details page.

            <li class="key-takeaway">
            Originally, the product team proposed removing the ‘email’ option and from our competitor/comparator research, we didn’t see it as a necessary CTA. From the analytics, we could see that almost as many users were selecting the email as they were the ‘get directions’ CTA on the current website. We presented these findings and decided to add it back in.
            </li>
            <li class="key-takeaway">
            Many users were actually landing on the detail page directly instead of the locations landing page which indicated our need for SEO text components and store personaliztion.
            </li>
            <li class="key-takeaway">
            Just as many users were selecting the phone number and get directions CTA from the landing page as they were from the details page, so these actions needed to be carried through the experience.

In some scenarios we created new components and identified interactions like a sticky map on scroll for mobile. This allowed users to see and interact with the map while scrolling through the list of stores.</p>
