            <h3>Growing Up an Artist</h3>
            <p>I found myself caught between two worlds, both of which were never quite right for me. In one I found myself in love with art, the creative freedom, and the strong emotions it could convey. I felt connected to the artist of every piece I looked at. I took art class every year and the class hour seemed to pass faster each time.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately I had always heard art wasn’t a real career path and for a while I listened to this. With doubts of ever making money and never really feeling like a true ‘artist’, I kept it as a hobby and explored other avenues. I became a Chemical Engineer, learning the trade of methodical problem solving which actually required quite a bit of creativity on the job.</p>
            <p>I’ve always had a desire to solve problems, the more difficult, the better. What I learned is that to ignite my passion (sometimes obsession), the problem had to relate to a specific topic: People. Enter my love, passion, and discovery of design.</p>
            <h3>Artist Turned Chemical Engineer</h3>
            <p>My second world consisted of math and chemistry, both of which fueled my desire for problem solving. I spent hours solving three page math problems and somehow enjoyed it. At the time this seemed to be a more acceptable career path. This combination of subjects led me to become a Chemical Engineer.</p>
            <p>I thought I didn’t belong as an artist, if only my teenage self could have seen me as an engineer. I realized this wasn’t the right path for me and I didn’t know what I was going to do with my life. In the past I believed a job was a job and you weren’t meant to be thrilled to do it.</p>
            <p>Luckily at this point in my life I had grown and knew that there was another way. I could do anything with my career if I put in enough work and I could be thrilled while doing it too.</p>
            <h3>Why Design?</h3>
            <p>To change careers I thought back, way back, to childhood and who I really was as a person. I remembered being a relatively quiet child that other children reached out to and even spilled their guts to. I was always connecting well with others, somehow always feeling their emotions and understanding their actions.</p>
            <p>That’s when I realized my career had to be connected to others. Yes I wanted to solve problems, but they had to be focused on people. My true passion isn’t necessarily art, math, or problem solving, it’s helping people. As a bonus I get to uncover that childhood artist.</p>
