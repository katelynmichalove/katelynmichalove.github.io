          <h5 class="sunbelt_title">SUNBELT RENTALS</h5>
          <p class="sunbelt_desc">Sunbelt Rentals rents a variety of equipment especially for the construction industry. There are several internal applications that help them keep up with their rentals. The equipment must be frequently maintained and often requires mechanics to travel to the customer’s location in order to resolve any equipment breakdowns.</p>
          <div class="the-client-four">
            <h5 class="white">THE CLIENT</h5>
            <p class="client_quote">&quot;SmartEquip is a parts procurement and equipment lifecycle software which helps Sunbelt with it’s equipment maintainance. SmartEquip  developed a solution which eliminated the need for the paper form and emailed images. However, they needed a designer to help redesign their UI and UX flow to increase usability and field adoption.&quot;</p>

I fill out my record form on paper, then on our Wynne system and again on the mobile app. I don’t really trust our current photo capture.&quot;</p>

          <div class="solution">
            <h2 class="section_title">The Solution</h2>
            <p>SmartEquip was redesigned to follow the human interface guidelines, human computer interaction fundamentals, and the Sunbelt Rentals style guide.  I also eliminated custom, unconventional icons and added icons that aided in the understanding of the tasks.</p>

              <p>In order to learn their workflow as quickly as possible, I scheduled a day long ‘Ride-Along’ where I rode  in Tod’s service vehicle as we went to customer locations in the area to fix equipment. I got to see his normal workflow and  the challenges he encounters.</p>
              <p>When it was time for lunch, we hit one of his usual spots, Waffle House. Even during this time, I got to see how he changed his status to ‘On Lunch’. Followed by a  looming countdown on his phone which he placed at the center of the table while we ate.</p>

                There are many photos captured throughout the process to document the before, after, the hour meter, the paper documents, the part conditions, and all angles of the equipment.

              <li class="key-takeaway">
                Documenting their work and transferring it to two different applications sometimes took longer than the actual work of fixing the equipment.

                      The menu was pulled out into the main inspection form so users could easily access this important information. I also renamed ‘Header Information’ to ‘Contract Information’ which is the title service technicians use.

                    <li class="key-takeaway">
                      Previously it took several steps to add one image. When riding along with technicians, I saw them take at least 50 - 75 photos. I redesigned this feature to allow them to select multiple photos at one time from their camera roll.

                  Users are presented with two pathways of either finding a part or adding a part that they’ve already used from the store or their truck.
                </li>
                <li class="key-takeaway">
                  When adding a part, the user can either search by part number or add it manually if their part can’t be found or doesn’t exist in the database.
                </li>
                <li class="key-takeaway">
                  When discussing with development, we determined there wasn’t enough time for a live search capability. Therefore, I designed a ‘Submit’ button that signaled the need for a full number entry. The error state also notifies the user that an entire part number must be entered into the field.
                </li>
                <li class="key-takeaway">
                  For the displayed results, I utilized a table that would allow them to adjust the quantity. I excluded information such as the ‘Stock Class’ which the user would not be familiar with and included what information they would need to find what they are looking for.
                </li>
                <li class="key-takeaway">
                  Finally, when the part is added, they still have the ability to adjust quantity and delete the part from their form. The total cost is clear so they can compare it to their invoice or truck inventory form.

                When starting this project I had no idea what a service technician really did with their day. I knew I had to spend some time seeing them in action before I could get started with any of my designs. Seeing how effective this was in contributing to successful design decisions, I’ve since carried this over to any other product I work on. Even before any sort of planned user research, I’ve found it most helpful to observe and spend time with the user.
              </li>
              <li class="key-takeaway">
                This was my first opportunity to shift a culture towards UX Design . My first meeting for this redesign started with the group asking: “So why do we need UX Design, what is it?”. A month later, after the redesign, they came to me to design a new feature, knowing now that this is a crucial first step in the development of their product. Now their concerns and questions are starting to reflect their new knowledge of best practices and it’s really exciting to see the transformation. I’ve always enjoyed design, but I never knew how much I would love influencing a culture and teaching others.
              </li>
              <li class="key-takeaway">
                Since the deadline was tight, I had to produce my designs and make decisions very quickly.  Given more time I could have explored better options and done usability testing with the service technicians to verify my designs. As they introduce my designs to the field during pilot, I will be able to make adjustments for users to continue my improvements.
